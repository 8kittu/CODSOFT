# Chatbot Project
================

A simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules.

## Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed on your system
* VSCode with the Python extension installed

### Running the Chatbot

1. Open the `chatbot.py` file in VSCode.
2. Run the file by clicking on the "Run Code" button or by pressing `F5`.
3. Interact with the chatbot by typing inputs and pressing Enter.

## Features
--------

* Responds to basic user inputs like "hello", "hi", "how are you", etc.
* Provides a default response for unknown inputs.

## Future Development
-------------------

* Add more responses to the chatbot's vocabulary.
* Implement more advanced natural language processing techniques.
* Integrate with external APIs or services to provide more functionality.
